 * Implementation of the group betweenness algorithm presented in Puzis et. al (2007): 'Fast algorithm for successive
 * computation of group betweenness centrality'. For a graph with <code>n</code> nodes and <code>m</code> edges it
 * computes a betweenness of a group with <code>k</code> members in <code>O(nk^2)</code>, which is dominated by
 * computation of shortest paths counts, partial dependencies, and distances (<code>O(nm)</code>) if <code>k<=sqrt(m)</code>.
 * However, these computations are done only once, so any group is then computed in <code>O(nk^2)</code>. The space
 * complexity is <code>O(n^2)</code>.
 * <p/>
 * Note that this algorithm differs from the original definition of group betweenness by Everett and Borgatti (Journal of
 * Mathematical Sociology, 1999): it doesn't discard paths which originate or end in a group node. If you don't want to
 * include them, instantiate this class with <code>includePeriphery=false</code>.
 * <p/>
 * This implementation works with weighted, undirected graphs. Unlike the original version presented
 * in the paper, this implementation works also with disconnected graphs - it then treats each connected component as a
 * separate graph. However, each group has to be connected, so if it is not, an exception is thrown.
 * <p/>
 * Note that shortest paths are determined by weights, which usually characterize importance, so you might want to
 * actually rather consider their complements, i.e. <code>(1-w)</code>.
 * <p/>
