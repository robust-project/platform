/**
 * Service interface for the Evaluation Engine, which is the high-level component that
 * deals with evaluating risks and opportunities.
 * 
 * The logic of the engine is to evaluate any risks or opportunities specified
 * in the risk repository (database) according to their evaluation schedules.
 *
 * To start the evaluation process, the engine must be started, which is one of the
 * method calls. The engine will then enter an infinite loop to perform its evaluation
 * task until a call to stop() is issued.
 * 
 * It is possible to subscribe to general events such as the engine starting and
 * stopping, as well as getting evaluation results for specific communities. This
 * is done via message streams, and any subscribers can get the URI to subscribe
 * to the specific streams they desire.
