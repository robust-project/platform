/**
 * Interface for the EvaluationEngine, which is the high-level component that
 * deals with evaluating risks and opportunities.
 * 
 * The logic of the engine is to evaluate any risks or opportunities specified
 * in the risk repository (database) according to their evaluation schedules.
 *
 * To start the evaluation process, the engine must be started, which is one of the
 * method calls. The engine will then enter an infinite loop to perform its evaluation
 * task until a call to stop() is issued.
 * 
 * It is possible to register to listen to new evaluation results with the
 * addListener() method. The component wishing to do so must implement the
 * IEvaluationEngineListener interface.
